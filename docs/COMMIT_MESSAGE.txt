fix: Implement database-first data persistence to prevent chat loss

PROBLEM:
- Chat sessions and messages were lost when users cleared browser cache
- Data was saved to database but frontend only loaded from localStorage
- Users couldn't access chats from different browsers/devices
- Caused data loss and poor user experience

SOLUTION:
- Created new API endpoint: GET /api/chat/[sessionId]/messages
- Modified chat-page-client.tsx to load chats from database when project selected
- Implemented database-first architecture with localStorage as performance cache
- Database is now the source of truth, localStorage used for speed only

CHANGES:
- Added app/api/chat/[sessionId]/messages/route.ts - loads chat messages from DB
- Modified components/chat-page-client.tsx - loads sessions from DB on project select
- Created supabase/migrations/20241110000000_create_chat_tables.sql
- Added comprehensive documentation (DATA_PERSISTENCE_FIX.md, TESTING_GUIDE.md)

BENEFITS:
✅ Data persists across browser cache clears
✅ Users can access chats from multiple devices
✅ No data loss on redeployment
✅ Professional, production-ready behavior
✅ Backward compatible with existing localStorage cache

TESTING:
- ✅ Code compiles successfully
- ✅ No linter errors  
- ⏳ Manual testing requires valid Supabase connection (see TESTING_GUIDE.md)

IMPACT: CRITICAL - Fixes data loss issue for production users
